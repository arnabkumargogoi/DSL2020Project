1,Manish,"Fluid and fantastic, with an average camera.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  What do I say about OnePlus device!!It was always my dream to own a OnePlus device, and here it is finally.I loved every aspect of this mobile but the only major drawback is the camera which could have been improved.The Ui is fluid and you will never face any lag or any such things.90 hz refresh rate is a little treat.4 star is just because of the camera otherwise it is a beast!The new update improved the performance a lot by bringing the AOD though it welcomes some bugs as well, but it's a smartphone and with time, it will also improve.If you have a budget around 40k then go ahead you will not regret, or you can save a little and get the big brother 8 Pro!"

8,avinash kumar,Not worth the flagship title,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is quite unstable, it's screen colour flickers automatically, basic calling function and clarity is not impressive, sometimes media volume not working. Screen stuck in landscape mode. Above is my experiance after using the phone for almost 6 months. Updated made the experiance of using the phone even worse, don't know if anyone else having such issues."
